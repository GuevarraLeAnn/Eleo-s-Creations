<!-- page instructions
    This page lists all the orders made by all the customers. Each item shows the
    order number, the name of the customer who made the order, and the date
    the order was made. Beside this are links to the edit and view details page for
    each order and a delete button to remove the order. List at least 3 orders.
    Only the first order item needs to have clickable buttons. This page should
    also have a link that goes to the Add Order page.


    The buttons should work similarly to how the buttons in the customer and
food list pages work, except it should go to the relevant pages for the relevant
order item. For the delete pages, name the files
confirm_order1_deletion.html and order1deleted.html.
