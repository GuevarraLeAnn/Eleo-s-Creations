  if label and input id not the same
  - The result is that the <label> and the <input> are actually not associated with each other at all.
    Visually, everything looks right. But the bug introduces two accessibility problems:
    - clicking the <label> won’t focus the form <input> to allow typing
    - a screen reader will describe the <input> wrong, by not saying the <input> is an “offer price”

<!-- INSTRUCTIONS

An order details page is a page that allows the user to view the details of a
chosen order - order number, date of order, name of customer who made the
order, food item names in the order, quantity per food item, total price per
item, and total price of the entire order.


The buttons should work similarly to how the buttons in the customer and
food details pages work, except it should go to the relevant pages for the
relevant order item.





Clicking on the Save button should bring the user back to the details page as
well, but this page should also have a message that confirms that the update
was a success. Name this page order1updated.html. You only need to
make this for one order.
