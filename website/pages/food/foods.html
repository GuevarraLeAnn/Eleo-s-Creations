<!-- page instructions
    This page lists all the food items that the website offers. Each item shows the
    name of the food item and its price. For each food item, there should be links
    to the edit details and view details pages, and a delete food button as well.

These pages will be described in the succeeding items. List at least 3 food
items. Only the first food item needs to have clickable buttons. This page
should also have a link that goes to the Add Food page.


The buttons should work similarly to how the buttons in the customers list
page work, except it should go to the relevant pages for the relevant food
item. For the delete pages, name the files
confirm_food1_deletion.html and food1deleted.html.
