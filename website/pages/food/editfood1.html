<!-- page instructions

This page allows the user to edit the details of a chosen food item. It will look
similar to the Add Food page, but it will have the food details in the fields, and
should have a Save and Cancel button for the changes. Clicking on the
Cancel button should bring the user back to the relevant food details page.
Clicking on the Save button should bring the user back to the details page as
well, but this page should also have a message that confirms that the update
was a success. Name this page food1updated.html. You only need to
make this for one customer.
